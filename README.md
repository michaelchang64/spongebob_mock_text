# Mocking Spongebob Text Converter

Ever felt too lazy to press the shift key at random letters when typing a mocking spongebob text? Then this tool is for you!

Just `git clone` this bad boy and run the following in your terminal (assuming you have Python3):
```
python mock.py "your text here!"
```
Here's some real output I got just by running this application! It probably won't look identical because this program randomly capitalizes or lowercases certain characters (basically randomly decides to convert certain characters to the opposite case)

Have fun ya lazy degenerates!
